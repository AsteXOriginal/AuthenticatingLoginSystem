<h1>Authenticating Login System</h1>
<p>Create a login simulation program that prompts for a password and only displays the welcome message if the entered password matches a pre-defined one in the program. In case of an error, display an error message and request to re-enter the password. After 3 failed attempts, the program should display a message about an unauthorized access attempt and terminate.

Task of increased complexity:
a) The program should include a user database (login and password), and it should require entering both the login and the corresponding password.
b) In case of an error in the login or password, display the respective error message.</p>
